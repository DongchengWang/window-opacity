# Window Opacity v0.2

Change the opacity/transparency of your window. Tested on Windows, but I don't know if it works on MacOS/Linux. If you
know how to make it work on other platforms, please feel welcome to open an issue/PR.

## Getting Started

1. run `WindowOpacity.exe`.
2. find the process names whose opacity you want to change.
3. type those names in the terminal.

## Running from Source

1. make sure you have .NET 5.0 or above installed.
2. run `dotnet run`.
