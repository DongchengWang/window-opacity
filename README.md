# Window Opacity v0.2

Change your window's opacity and make it transparent. Tested on Windows, but I don't know if it works on MacOS/Linux. If
you know how to make it work on other platforms, feel welcome to open an issue/PR.

## Getting Started

1. run `WindowOpacity.exe`.
2. find the process name whose opacity you want to change.
3. type those names in the terminal.

## Config

See `config.json` and `Config.cs`.

## Running from Source

1. make sure you have .NET 5.0 or above installed.
2. run `dotnet run`.
