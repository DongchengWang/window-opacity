# Window Opacity

Change your window's opacity, make it transparent on Windows. Tested on Windows, but I don't know if it works on
MacOS/Linux. If you know how to make it work on other platforms, feel welcome to open an issue/PR.

## Getting started

1. make sure `config.json` is in the installed directory.
2. run `WindowOpacity.exe`.

## Config

Check out `config.json` and `Config.cs`.

## Running from source

1. make sure you have .NET 6.0 or above installed.
2. run `dotnet run`.
